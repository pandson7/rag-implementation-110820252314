RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Implementation Requirements

OBJECTIVE:
Create a RAG implementation with natural language interface for document querying.

KEY REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use documents from "~/ea_sample_docs/rag_docs" folder as knowledge source
2. Provide natural language question interface
3. Test functionality with sample questions
4. Validate responses using actual sourced documents (not simulated context)
5. Set up all dependencies correctly
6. Fix any issues during testing
7. Ensure sample tests return expected responses
8. Create frontend interface
9. Start development server and launch webapp

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Document source: ~/ea_sample_docs/rag_docs
- Interface: Natural language Q&A
- Validation: Real document sourcing required
- Deployment: Web application with development server

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Functional RAG system
- Accurate document retrieval
- Natural language processing
- Working web interface
- Validated test responses
